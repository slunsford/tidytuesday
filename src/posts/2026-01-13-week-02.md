The [first curated dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2026/2026-01-13/readme.md) for 2026 is African languages, including country, language family, and speaker count.

I took a lot of different stabs at this one before landing on an approach. I tried a scatter plot looking at total number of speakers versus number of countries for each language, across all… *\*(checks notes)\**

```sql
select count(distinct language) from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2026/2026-01-13/africa.csv"
```

…502 languages. That looked like an unreadable cluster in the lower left with a handful of dots scattered around the rest of the chart area (most notably Arabic, spoken natively by 1.8 billion people across 12 countries).

After thinking about it for a minute, I actually wanted to zoom in on the ones closest to (0, 0)—the ones spoken by the fewest people. There's no defined threshold for an [endangered language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language#Defining_and_measuring_endangerment), but 1000 left me with a manageable 26 languages.

A few things I noticed:

- All of these are spoken within the borders of a single country, except Aja, split across the Central African Republic and South Sudan.
- A lot of these are in Cameroon.
- *Twelve* speakers?!

## Data Transformation

The final query I ended up using was:

```sql
create or replace table languages as

-- Get languages with up to 1000 speakers, totaled across countries
with languages as (
   select language,
          country,
          native_speakers,
          sum(native_speakers) over (partition by language) as total_speakers

     from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2026/2026-01-13/africa.csv"
  qualify total_speakers <= 1000
),

-- Pivot on countries to create an individual series for each
pivot_countries as (
    pivot languages on country
    using sum(native_speakers)
 order by total_speakers
)

-- Drop the total_speakers column from the final table
select * exclude total_speakers from pivot_countries
```

I copied the resulting `languages` table to CSV.
