    alt: Sankey diagram titled 'Follow the Money' showing grant commitments from Science Foundation Ireland's top 10 programs to research institutions from 2000 to 2024. The Research Centres Programme dominates with €991M in commitments, followed by the Principal Investigator Programme at €594M. Trinity College Dublin is the largest recipient overall, receiving major funding from nearly all programs, followed by University College Dublin and University of Galway. Other significant recipients include University College Cork, University of Limerick, and Tyndall National Institute. The diagram reveals heavy concentration of funding among traditional universities, with smaller allocations to technological universities and research institutes.

This week's data is for SFI grants to research institutions over the course of its existence, from 2000 to July 2024.

What would've been interesting to explore is the change in commitments by program[me]s/recipients over time. But this week it was a lot quicker and easier to do another Sankey showing flow from programs to research bodies. I limited it to the top 10 programs by total commitment to reduce the scope (i.e. size) of the chart.

## The Query

I tried to filter the programs with a `qualify` statement first, but I couldn't get the incantation right (and maybe that's just not possible). So instead I fell back to a CTE and a join.

The first version used a subquery (`where programme_name in (select programme_name from top_programmes`), but this allowed me to get the total commitment for sorting the final chart too.

```sql
with top_programmes as (
     select programme_name,
            sum(current_total_commitment) as total_programme_commitment,

       from sfi_grants
   group by all
   order by total_programme_commitment desc
   limit 10
)

     select programme_name,
            research_body,
            sum(current_total_commitment) as commitment,
            total_programme_commitment

       from sfi_grants
       join top_programmes
      using (programme_name)
   group by all
   order by total_programme_commitment desc, commitment desc
```
