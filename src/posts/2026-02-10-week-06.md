    alt: Stacked bar chart titled "Cold Play" showing the number of 2026 Winter Olympics events by discipline. Curling leads with 436 total events, almost entirely non-medal events. Freestyle Skiing (222) and Snowboard (192) follow with mostly non-medal and medal events. Sliding sports like Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton have significant training events alongside their competition schedules—Bobsleigh has 72 training events, Luge has 70, and Skeleton has 36. Speed Skating and Cross-Country Skiing are medal-heavy with 42 and 35 medal events respectively. Biathlon has only medal events (33).

This week's dataset is the event schedule for the Olympics. I decided to compare the number of events across sports, breaking out training and medal events.

Also, I'm publishing this while watching women move at Interstate speeds on nothing but a sled.

Speaking of which, it was interesting to note that luge (what we are watching) and bobsleigh both have the most training events of all of them. We'd just been wondering how athletes train for this, and the commentators mentioned that there are 15 active tracks in the world (of which Germany has three). So it makes sense that there'd be a lot more onsite training for those sports.

## Queries

This was a nice clean dataset to work with (thanks to the contributor), so I didn't need to do anything beyond aggregating what I wanted.

```sql
   select discipline_name,
          count_if(is_medal_event) as medal_events,
          count_if(not is_training and not is_medal_event) as non_medal_events,
          count_if(is_training) as training_events,
     from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2026/2026-02-10/schedule.csv"
 group by all
 order by count(*) desc
```
