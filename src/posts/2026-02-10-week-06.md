This week's dataset is the event schedule for the Olympics. I decided to compare the number of events across sports, breaking out training and medal events.

Also, I'm publishing this while watching women move at Interstate speeds on nothing but a sled.

Speaking of which, it was interesting to note that luge (what we are watching) and bobsleigh both have the most training events of all of them. We'd just been wondering how athletes train for this, and the commentators mentioned that there are 15 active tracks in the world (of which Germany has three). So it makes sense that there'd be a lot more onsite training for those sports.

## Queries

This was a nice clean dataset to work with (thanks to the contributor), so I didn't need to do anything beyond aggregating what I wanted.

```sql
   select discipline_name,
          count_if(is_medal_event) as medal_events,
          count_if(not is_training and not is_medal_event) as non_medal_events,
          count_if(is_training) as training_events,
     from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2026/2026-02-10/schedule.csv"
 group by all
 order by count(*) desc
```
