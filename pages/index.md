title: Sean Tidies Tuesdays

Here's my foray into [TidyTuesday](https://tidytues.day/). I don't know how frequently I'm going to be able to do this, but as I do, pages will be added to the sidebar on the left.

I'm using [Evidence](https://www.evidence.dev/), a static site generator that runs [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) under the hood to let you build a data-oriented site with Markdown and SQL. DuckDB has become [one of my favorite things](https://seanlunsford.com/2024/bringing-sql-to-a-python-fight/), so while I know most participants are using languages like R or Python, of course I'm going to tackle these with good old SQL and DuckDB. You can show/hide the SQL queries behind this data from the `•••` menu in the upper right.

I'd love to actually get into the CSS of this website at some point and make it my own, but in the interest of getting something up, we're just going with off-the-shelf Evidence for now.
